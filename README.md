# petti

The name "Petti" in my native language malayalam translates to box , thought its a good idea to name a toy database after a box. :) 
 While learning about relational databases, I also built one from scratch using Rust. This has been heavily inspired by the tutorial at https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/ .
